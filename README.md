# PostCSS starter workflow

This is not a framework properly, but kind a set of postcss tools starter kit for websites. 
The idea is to work the new css syntax and leave the common preprocessors structure in my actual workflow; and switch the way we work in a few years under the w3c standars like web-components, es6 and css new syntax.

##Tools
Gulpfile tasks and postcss plugins; development still in progress, i think to add some features to work with html layouts and external data:

- [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/)
- [CssNext](cssnext.io)
- [Lost grid](http://corysimmons.github.io/lost/)
- [Autoprefixer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/autoprefixer)
- [JS Uglify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-uglify)
- [Browser-Sync](http://www.browsersync.io/)
